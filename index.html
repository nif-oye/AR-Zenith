            Augmented Reality (AR) is the digital wizardry that blurs the line
            between the real and virtual. Instead of diving headfirst into an
            alternate universe like Virtual Reality (VR), AR sprinkles digital
            magic into our world, overlaying interactive 3D elements onto your
            everyday surroundings. Whether through smartphones, glasses, or
            fancy headsets, AR lets you play in a space where the real world
            meets the digital frontier.

            From Stark Tech to Pocket Monsters
          </h3>
          <p class="montserrat-alternates-regular">
            AR wasn't always a reality; it began as the brainchild of sci-fi
            visionaries. Remember Tony Stark's holographic, flick-of-the-wrist
            interfaces in Iron Man? That heads-up display was the blueprint for
            what we now know as AR. Minority Report took it up a notch,
            imagining a future where entire cities run on augmented reality,
            with people waving through holograms and controlling digital
            interfaces midair. Fast forward to today, and those wild fantasies
            have materialized in the form of Google Glass (RIP), and the AR
            sensation Pokémon Go, where we all turned into virtual Pokémon
            trainers.

          <h3 class="orbitron-small-header">Not Just for Gamers</h3>
          <p class="montserrat-alternates-regular">
            AR has officially stepped out of the movies and into our homes,
            classrooms, and beyond. In gaming, AR lets us bring monsters into
            our living rooms. But it's not all fun and games—AR is also
            transforming industries like architecture and retail. Ever tried to
            virtually place a couch in your living room? Apps like IKEA Place
            let you drag-and-drop 3D furniture into your space, giving you a
            sneak peek at how it'll look IRL. AR is everywhere—from boosting
            marketing campaigns with interactive ads to reimagining the
            classroom by layering educational content over the real world. It's
            more than just a gimmick; it's the future.
